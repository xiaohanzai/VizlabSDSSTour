# VizlabSDSSTour

A visualization project created for VizLab at Carnegie Observatories that allows interaction with SDSS data.

The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) is a multi-spectral imaging and spectroscopic redshift survey.
This project illustrates the large-scale structure of the universe in VR by plotting galaxy positions in 3D, and allows interaction with the galaxies by selecting a galaxy and grabbing the galaxy images and spectra through the SDSS API.
It also prints out the galaxy location, redshift, and mass upon selection.

Here's a video showing the desired effect.  I can't record what's happening in VizLab because that VR facility is basically linear polarization 3D glases...

The other project I did at the VizLab is this: https://github.com/xiaohanzai/VizlabLSSPython.
This one generates synthetic data at run time and updates the data points in VR.
