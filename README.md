# VizlabSDSSTour
A visualization project created for VizLab at Carnegie Observatories that allows interaction with SDSS data.
The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) is a multi-spectral imaging and spectroscopic redshift survey.
This project shows some galaxy data and allows interaction with the data by grabbing the galaxy images and spectra through the SDSS API.
It also prints out the galaxy location, redshift, and mass upon selection.

Here's a video showing the desired effect.  I can't record what's happening in VizLab because that VR facility is basically linear polarization 3D glases...
